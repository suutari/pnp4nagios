pnp4nagios (0.6.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Adapted versioned build-dep on libjs-jquery-ui to the workaround used by
      that package (1.8.14 -> 1.8.ooops.14). Thanks to Christoph Anton
      Mitterer for reporting this (Closes: #683100).
  * debian/patches/:
    - adjust-template-path: Fixed the patch for empty templates.d and some
      versions of glob() which in this case returns nothing resulting in PHP
      syntax errors and a crash of PNP4Nagios; thanks to Christoph Anton
      Mitterer for reporting this and pointing out a fix (Closes: #683138).

  * New upstream version.
  * debian/control:

  * debian/pnp4nagios-bin.install:
    - Install verify_pnp_config_v2.pl to /u/l/pnp4nagios/libexec/.
  * debian/pnp4nagios-web.postinst:
    - Call a2mod / restart apache2 only if the binaries are available; thanks

pnp4nagios (0.6.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Added more verbose instructions about how to setup mod_gearman mode.
  * debian/patches/:
    - Removed manpage-hyphen -- applied upstream.
  * debian/rules:
    - Don't remove scripts/rc.pnp_gearman_worker in 'clean' -- this is now
      taken care of in the upstream Makefile.
  * debian/po/:
    - Added Japanese debconf translation; thanks to Hideki Yamane for
      providing the translation (Closes: #626386).

pnp4nagios (0.6.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches/:
    - Removed raise-process-perfdata-timeout -- a similar patch has been
      included upstream.
    - Added manpage-hyphen -- do not use hyphens as minus sign in npcd.8.
  * debian/rules:
    - npcd.cfg and process_perfdata.cfg are not longer installed as sample
      configs by the upstream Makefile; so, don't rename those files.
    - Do not pass --prefix to configure and set man-/infodir correctly. The
      prefix is set by layout=debian and cannot be overwritten, thus do not
      pretend this is possible. Also, do not use $prefix when setting man-/
      infodir but specify the complete path.
    - Do not install config_local.php and config.php.$PKG_VERSION.
    - Remove generated scripts/rc.pnp_gearman_worker in 'clean'.
  * debian/rules, debian/pnp4nagios-bin.install:
    - Do not install npcd.8 using dh_installman; this is done by the upstream
      Makefile now.
  * debian/pnp4nagios-bin.pnp_gearman_worker.default,
    pnp4nagios-bin.pnp_gearman_worker.init:
    - Added init script for the PNP4Nagios Gearman worker daemon.
    - The daemon is disabled by default.

pnp4nagios (0.6.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/po/:
    - Added French debconf translation; thanks to Christian Perrier for
      providing the translation (Closes: #623181).
    - Added German debconf translation.
    - Added Russian debconf translation; thanks to Yuri Kozlov for providing
      the translation (Closes: #623798).
  * debian/pnp4nagios-web.postinst:
    - Do not set permissions of /var/log/pnp4nagios/stats -- this is done in
      pnp4nagios-bin.postinst which ships the directory. This fixes an error
      when installing -web without -bin.

pnp4nagios (0.6.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sven Velt ]
  * Initial release (Closes: #479031)
  * Use "php-fpdf", "php-fpdf-tpl" and "php-fpdi" packages instead of bundled
    copies.
  * Do not use the bundled copy of Kohana2 but rather depend on
    libkohana2-php.
  * Ship all configuration in /etc and create appropriate symlinks.
  * Ship upstream sample configs as default configs.
  * debian/patches:
    - Added adjust-template-path: install templates into /etc/ rather than
      /usr/share/.
    - Added apache-fix-path-to-userfile: fix config directory in the sample
      httpd.conf.
    - Added fix-nagios-url: fix cgi-bin path in config.php.
    - Added fix-npcd-path: fix perfdata paths in npcd.cfg.
    - Added fix-path-fpdi: FPDI is shipped in its own subdirectory -- adopt
      path in pdf.php.
    - Added raise-process-perfdata-timeout: set timeout to 10s in
      process_perfdata.cfg; in large and/or virtualized setups, 5s might not
      be enough.

  [ Sebastian Harl ]
  * Build the following binary packages:
    - pnp4nagios-bin: NPCD and process_perfdata.pl
    - pnp4nagios-web: web interface
    - pnp4nagios: metapackage depending on the other two
  * debian/watch: mangle upstream version to replace ".rc" with "~rc".
  * Make Apache2 configuration optional using debconf.
